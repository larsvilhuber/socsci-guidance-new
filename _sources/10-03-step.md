# Ideal structure of a replication package

The AEA uses the openICPSR platform for replication packages. The platform allows users to download complete "deposits", or only subdirectories thereof. However, deposits of replication packages at other trusted repositories are also accepted, as long as they satisfy the requirements described here.

> Users must not upload ZIP packages as files - rather, ZIP files can be used to structure code and data, but should be unzipped on the platform ("import from ZIP"). The exception is when there are [more than 1,000 files in the repository](#structure-in-the-presence-of-more-than-1000-files).

The code and data should run as downloaded from the repository, without further manual modifications (creating empty subdirectories programmatically is acceptable). Because code tends to be small, but data can be large, we strongly advise to not commingle data and code - interested researchers can download  the code directory by itself if they wish, without also downloading a potentially very large data directory.

A simple template might be

```
README.pdf
data/
   raw/
      cps0001.dat
   analysis/
      combined_data.dta
      combined_data.csv
      combined_data_codebook.pdf
code/
  01_create/
      01_readcps.R
      02_readfred.R
  02_analysis/
      01_table1-5.R
      02_figures1-4.R
results/
  table1.tex
  table2.tex
  ...
  figure1.pdf
  figure2.pdf
```

## No manual modifications

The replication package should reproduce the tables and figures, as well as any in-text numbers, by **running code without manual intervention**. 

> The only exception to this rule is a single change to set a small number of program and data directory paths.

While running a small number of distinct programs separately  is acceptable (in some cases even desirable), it is **not acceptable** to require replicators to manually enter numbers, or configure parameter files, in order to reproduce the tables and figures in the paper. Nevertheless, it should be clear from the manuscript and the code how a replicator might deviate from the tables and figures in the paper. 

## Structure in the presence of more than 1,000 files

As of 2021, ICPSR cannot accept deposits with more than 1,000 files. Therefore, we relax the rule that all data and code must be unzipped, though we still insist on the "smallest possible configuration".

In most cases, it is a particular directory that is the primary culprit. Say you have

`Structure-pre:`
```
/code: 20 files
/data/
   src1/: 25 files
   src2/: 101 files
   src3/: 3,000 files
```

then the ideal structure, taking into account the 1,000 file limit, would be:

`Structure-post:`
```
/code: 20 files
/data/
   src1/: 25 files
   src2/: 101 files
   src3.zip: = 1 file, containing 3,000 files
```
(src3/ and its 3,000 files have been removed!)

Your README should provide instructions to the replicators how to recover the fully unzipped structure (there are cross-platform differences in unzipping, so be precise about the final structure, rather than the method of getting there).

Alternatively, the code can handle the unzipping - optional, but more robust.

Once you've adjusted that, zip up the whole structure (so a ZIP file that has inside it another zip file, plus the `/code`, `/data/src1/`, and `/data/src2/` directories), and "Import from ZIP" when uploading to ICPSR.

## Structure in the presence of confidential (unpublished) data

When the replication package relies on confidential data that cannot be shared, or is shared under different conditions, authors will have to

- prepare a confidential (partial) replication package
  - this would contain the contents of `data/confidential` and possibly `data/conf_analysis` from the example below.
- preserve (archive) the confidential replication package
  - If the data cannot be removed from a secure enclave, they should nevertheless be archived wherever the confidential data are kept (see [this FAQ](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/FAQ.html#how-can-i-ensure-that-the-confidential-data-is-preserved))
  - If the data can be shared, but are subject to access restrictions, follow  [this guide on creating a separate data deposit](creating-separate-data-deposit) and, when creating the restricted deposit at ICPSR, follow [these instructions on how to do so](creating-restricted-data-deposit-icpsr).
- prepare a non-confidential replication package that contains all code, and any data that is not subject to publication controls
  - this would contain the contents of `data/raw`, `data/analysis`, `code/`, and for reference, `results/` from the example below.
- ensure that replicators have detailed instructions on how to combine the two packages 
- specify  which (if any) of the results in their paper can be reproduced without the confidential data. 


Clearly separate the restricted from the open-access data, both in terms of the raw data as well as the processed data:

```
data/
   raw/
      cps0001.dat
   confidential/
      ssa.csv
   conf_analysis/
      confidential_combined.dta
```

Keep in mind that you may be able to provide a subset of your replication package privately to the AEA Data Editor, see  the [Sharing restricted-access data with the AEA Data Editor](sharing-restricted-data) page, or that you might be able to [create a separate data deposit](creating-separate-data-deposit) with a more [limited license](Licensing_guidance). 

Authors might want to investigate the  possibility of providing "fake" or "simulated" data that might allow replicators to run code, without necessarily obtaining meaningful results (functionality test).

## Creating a separate data deposit

In situations where the data has a different license, or where the data you include has value separately from your replication package, you can create a separate data deposit, and link it/reference it/cite it.

## Considering the replicator

The replicator of your package is likely to be less qualified than you are. After all, you are publishing something novel.

You should assume

- that the replicator has basic knowledge in how to run your software package, if the software is commonly used in economics
  - Stata, Matlab, some others are commonly used
  - Compiled or new computer languages are much less likely to be widely used, even if they are used in your subdiscipline

![software usage](/images/figure_software_years_pct.png)

You can assume

- that the replicator can manipulate a top-level configuration file 
  - for instance, to set a base directory
  - but not setting a base directory at the top of 25 different files

You should NOT assume

- that the replicator will use the same type of operating system
  - describe any *hard* requirements, but do not impose any *fake* requirements
  - most Stata, Matlab, SAS, R, Python, etc. can run on any operating system, unless you hard-code platform-specific commands into your code 
- that the replicator has any of your packages/modules/etc. installed
  - provide a setup program to install these (not manual instructions). 
  - provide copies of such packages/modules when the package repository does not allow you to specify a version 
  - provide a container/ Docker image/ VM that comprises all the necessary software and libraries
- that the replicator will run the software the same way you do
  - some software can be run in different ways (interactive, batch, etc.) and may behave differently depending on how it s run. 
  - For instance, Stata will change the working directory to that of the program being run in batch mode, but not if running interactively
  - For instance, running R code using Rstudio may behave differently than running it with `rscript`

For less frequently used software, provide a URL where the software can be obtained. 

  - essentially, if not listed in the figure above, provide information on how to obtain software
  - if using commercial compilers, we also suggest to compile your code using open-source or free compilers (including any free performance packages, such as Intel MKL), even if the resulting code is not the most efficient.
  - as of 2021, the AEA Data Editor has access to the software on [this list](https://ciser.cornell.edu/computing/computing-account-software/), and any open-source (free) software that can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
