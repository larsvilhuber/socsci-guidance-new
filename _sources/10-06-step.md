# Preparing to upload

Once you are done preparing your replication package, you should upload it:

- if you have received a conditional acceptance, your replication  package **must** be in a trusted repository. The default trusted repository is the [AEA Data and Code Repository](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/aea/studies). Other trusted repositories may be acceptable (see [list](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_hosting.html#trusted-repositories)), but replication packages should meet the [display guidelines](guidelines-other-repositories). 
- if you have confidential data that you want to transmit to the AEA Data Editor but do not want published, communicate with the AEA Data Editor directly (see [this FAQ](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/faq#restricted) and [Sharing restricted-access data with the AEA Data Editor](sharing-restricted-data)).
- if you have received instructions during the revise-and-resubmit process to have a reproducibility check conducted, you may use the AEA Data and Code Repository, but other methods are also acceptable. Do not forget, however, that once the paper is accepted, it **must** be made available on a trusted repository - other methods are then no longer acceptable.
