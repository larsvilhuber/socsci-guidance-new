# Describing the contents of your replication package

Every replication package requires a document outlining where the data comes from, what data is provided, what requirements are needed to run the code in the replication package, how to run the code, what results to expect, and where to find the results. This is conventionally called the "README". 

- The AEA requires that the README follow a prescribed schema.  Please use the [template README for social science replication packages](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/).

Follow the instructions within the template README, and provide it as part of your replication package.
