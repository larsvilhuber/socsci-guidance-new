# Re-run your replication package

Ideally, once you have prepared your replication package, you should re-run the code again, in a clean environment, possibly a fresh computer, to ensure that (a) the package is, in fact, reproducible with minimal interaction (b) the results are numerically identical. 

- Wherever possible, we strongly encourage running in batch (non-interactive) mode.
