# Guidance on preparing and submitting replication packages - Overview

- Prepare your data and code replication package (including data citations and provenance information). You can do this at any time, even before submitting to any of the journals.
- Upload: Provide metadata and upload the replication package. This step simultaneously prepares the materials for the verification process as well as for subsequent publication.
- Submit the Data and Code Availability Form together with your manuscript native files as instructed, and as per guidelines at your journal (for example, AER guidelines). Only once these materials have been received by the editorial office are verification checks started.
