# Data Citations

All manuscripts will be checked for data citations. If you have not done so, now is the time to add them to your
manuscript. 

## What to cite

All datasets actively used in your replication package that are not your own must be cited. Just as with any other literature, this serves to properly identify the provenance of the information you use, and attribution of credit to the original creator. Data you created should also be cited, either by pointing to a data deposit you made elsewhere, or by pointing to your own (forthcoming) data deposit at the AEA.

## Where to cite

Every citation has an in-text entry (`Smith (2020)` or `(Smith, 2020)`), and a list entry in the Reference section (see the [Chicago Manual of Style Quick Guide](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html)). This is true for data citations as well. 

- Your data citations should be listed in the **Reference section** of the **manuscript**. 

In rare circumstances, when there are too many data citations to accomodate succinctly, data citations for sources can be deferred to an online data appendix. In all cases, for clarity, all data citations should **also** appear in the [README](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/template-README.html), including with a separate [Reference section](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/template-README.html#references).

## Data citations and Data Availability Statements

In many cases, the data citation for a public-use dataset has a unique URL that is sufficient for downloading the dataset:

> Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2000–2010. “Current Employment Statistics: Colorado, Total Nonfarm, Seasonally adjusted - SMS08000000000000001.” *United States Department of Labor*. http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?sm+08 (accessed February 9, 2011).

However, in many other cases where the URL does not lead directly to the dataset, a separate "Data Availability Statement" needs to be provided, as part of the README. A simple data citation is not sufficient. See [general guidance on data availability statements](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_dcas.html), and [some examples in the template README](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/template-README.html#data-availability-and-provenance-statements).
